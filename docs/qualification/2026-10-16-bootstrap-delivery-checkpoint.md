# Bootstrap delivery checkpoint — 2026-10-16

Assignment receiver16, owning receiver10. This checkpoint records delivered
source and measured CI separately from unexecuted public/runtime acceptance.
It is not the assignment Finalization or a replacement producer contract.

## Delivered source and exact evidence

- Source [PR17](https://github.com/pcvantol/djconnect-vibecast-receiver/pull/17):
  candidate a40a51abc088299f3d16f06942ed9636eb64639b, protected main
  b29b6b04ed26aa955df75af4389ce016ba3517d9, identical tree
  a97b964c41158e39ae2b80a38bb2c58000763089. Independent technical/privacy and
  product/UX GO. Linux CI38861929475, projection38861929603 and main38862230799 SUCCESS.
  Earlier Linux QR-resize failures remain failures; the fixed candidate passed
  all34 real Chromium/WebKit browser cases without relaxed assertions.
- Owner-selfreview [PR18](https://github.com/pcvantol/djconnect-vibecast-receiver/pull/18):
  candidate67bf87e9b85f20edbfb355bba59fd26caacd50a4, main
  2e6b8f9f29449d5d07931a0bd4c744518b196b33, identical reviewed tree
  143836d8d773c8109d587ed03c0eee8e9f5a46e1. Both independent reviews GO;
  45Node+9Python local checks PASS. CandidateCI38864853685/projection38864853689
  and [mainCI38865047408](https://github.com/pcvantol/djconnect-vibecast-receiver/actions/runs/38865047408)/projection38865047389 SUCCESS.
- Downloaded actual main artifact bootstrap-2e6b8f9f29449d5d07931a0bd4c744518b196b33:
  exact source identity, full member inventory and every file hash PASS.
  build-manifest.json SHA256
  b07ed1e3524004ceb50a8066386be1dc11c91621604b558d018fd11c487f03bb.
  The artifact belongs to that measured main, not an unknown future docs merge.
- Existing Cast wwwroot/vendor/source locks unchanged. After source and policy
  merges, actual receiver HTTPS HTML/manifest bytes and privacy readbacks PASS.
  This proves distribution, not actual CAF or physical visibility.

Durable measured receipts: owning10/[6210089122](https://github.com/pcvantol/djconnect-vibecast-receiver/issues/10#issuecomment-6210089122).
CI retention is capped by the repository at2days. A verified extracted artifact
is retained at /private/tmp/vibecast16-main-artifact-2e6b8f9, but that local copy
is not a durable release or a substitute for a trusted CI artifact. If the CI
artifact expires before promotion, obtain a fresh successful trusted push/main
run for the current reviewed main; never upload an untrusted replacement under
an old receipt. No file cleanup is authorized by this checkpoint.

## External configuration and remaining access

Separate Pages Direct Upload project vibecast-tv-bootstrap exists, no Git source:
project a815fc66-5fc2-49d3-812f-28b7401b6643, account
 efe77cadf8317a53832fca0848e3ae51. No bootstrap artifact was uploaded.
Production root remains https://vibecast.tv; existing receiver project and origin
are separate and retained.

Peter authorized Cloudflare deployment and explicitly owner-selfreview. Actual
vibecast-production: sole required User pcvantol/id19624891,
prevent_self_review=false, can_admins_bypass=false, protected branches only.
An approval is still mandatory. Prior setting retained for rollback; exact
configuration receipt is owning10/[6210044260](https://github.com/pcvantol/djconnect-vibecast-receiver/issues/10#issuecomment-6210044260).
No repeat generic merge/deploy/selfreview approval is needed within this scope.

At this checkpoint the environment secret inventory is empty. Required minimum
owner action: add an account-scoped Cloudflare Pages Edit token as
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN in repository environment vibecast-production. Keep DNS
read/edit access separately bounded to vibecast.tv. Do not send secrets in chat.
Existing OAuth cannot list DNS records (10000) or issue scoped tokens (9109);
no broad OAuth is reused in CI. No records are assumed empty or overwritten.

## Acceptance matrix and next measured action

| Category | Current evidence | Next required evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SOURCE_DELIVERED | YES, PR17/18 exact tree and protected merge | Checkpoint docs exact candidate/main readback after their own delivery |
| CI_QUALIFIED | PASS source/build/browser/artifact | Current-main trusted artifact for actual promotion |
| PAGES_DEPLOYED | NOT_RUN_ACCESS_GATE | Scoped credential, qualified fixed config, approved environment job; immutable HTTPS/hash/full-header readback |
| DOMAIN_TLS_VERIFIED | NOT_VERIFIED | Actual DNS inventory/prior binding, bounded binding, valid TLS and root/redirect/contenttype/hash/header/404 readback |
| RENDEZVOUS_CONNECTED | BLOCKED_BY_NAMED_CONTRACT | Exact API/TRUST producer pin with positive/negative fixtures; reviewed static adapter and CSP |
| APPLE_HA_ONBOARDING_E2E | OPEN | Qualified Apple scanner and HA display two-step admission, real destination and separate six-digit approval |
| PHYSICAL_TV_ACCEPTANCE | NOT_RUN | Real target/browser/device receipt; QR readability, performance/effects/accessibility and handoff/expiry/recovery on hardware |

The physical matrix is a prepared acceptance list, not a device reservation or
hardware test result. Service tests use synthetic fixtures only; public entry
remains explicitly unavailable and emits no fake QR or service request.

## Publication continuation and rollback

1. Verify scoped credential availability without logging it, actual environment
   protection and fixed target. Qualify deployment.json through independent
   reviews, required CI and protected merge; leave it unqualified before then.
2. Use the exact current-main successful trusted CI artifact, verify its manifest
   and every member, dispatch the protected workflow and provide required owner
   approval. Never bypass the environment through a local upload.
3. Read actual immutable deployment and root with normal TLS, all expected
   hashes/contenttypes and artifact-bound cache/referrer/CSP/permissions policy,
   clean/index redirect and true404. Read existing Cast before and after.
4. Inventory DNS through a real authorized route before binding. Preserve prior
   values. On failure remove only the newly added binding/restore exact prior
   values; no Cast-project rollback or unrelated DNS changes. For later artifact
   rollback use a dedicated reviewed candidate and the controlled workflow;
   normal stale-main protection intentionally rejects arbitrary old runs.
5. Record actual receipts separately, then own protected Finalization and terminal
   Core1101 handoff. Leave unqualified onboarding/physical outcomes visibly open.

Requests remain [API90](https://github.com/pcvantol/djconnect-api/issues/90#issuecomment-6201943165),
[Core1101](https://github.com/pcvantol/djconnect/issues/1101#issuecomment-6201943586),
[Apple87](https://github.com/pcvantol/djconnect-app/issues/87#issuecomment-6201943988).
No producer implementation, new receiver slice or full-product completion is
inferred from this document. Source/evidence work remains within issue16.
